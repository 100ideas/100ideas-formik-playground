#### thanks

Thanks @jaredpalmer's snappy css boilerplate (from formik-v2 codesandbox), it looks nice. Not sure if it's helpful, but if anyone wants to play around with it, feel free. Just fork the repo or play around in the stackblitz browser ide. But more than the css, *thank you* @jaredpalmer for creating formik & documenting it well.

also "thank you" to @ersel for demonstrating how to recreate the functionality of `<FastField>` in ^v2.0.3 https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/1739#issuecomment-521175764

thanks, stackblitz, for the free, snappy (ususally) browser IDE

thanks to google for the free hosting on google firebase

and thank you *reader* for playing around!
